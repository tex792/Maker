#include <Servo.h>  // servo library

// Once you "include" a library, you'll have access to those
// functions. You can find a list of the functions in the servo
// library at: http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo
// Most libraries also have example sketches you can load from
// the "file/examples" menu.

// Now we'll create a servo "object", called myservo. You should
// create one of these for each servo you want to control. 
// You can control a maximum of twelve servos on the Uno 
// using this library. (Other servo libraries may let you
// control more). Note that this library disables PWM on
// pins 9 and 10!

Servo servo1;  // servo control object

int servoDelay = 20; //Set the delay between steps as a global variable


void setup()
{
  // We'll now "attach" the servo1 object to digital pin 9.
  // If you want to control more than one servo, attach more
  // servo objects to the desired pins (must be digital).

  // Attach tells the Arduino to begin sending control signals
  // to the servo. Servos require a continuous stream of control
  // signals, even if you're not currently moving them.
  // While the servo is being controlled, it will hold its 
  // current position with some force. If you ever want to
  // release the servo (allowing it to be turned by hand),
  // you can call servo1.detach().

  servo1.attach(9);

  Serial.begin(9600);
  
}


void loop()
{
  int position;
  
  // To control a servo, you give it the angle you'd like it
  // to turn to. Servos cannot turn a full 360 degrees, but you
  // can tell it to move anywhere between 0 and 180 degrees.

  // Tell servo to go to 0 degrees, stepping by one degree

  for(position = 180; position >= 0; position -= 1)
  {                                
    Serial.println(servo1.read()); //output to serial display
    servo1.write(position);  // Move to next position
    delay(servoDelay); // Short pause to allow it to move, uses global
                       // variable 'servoDelay'
  }
